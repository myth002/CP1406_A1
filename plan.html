<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Anumolu Sandeep Prasad<br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The primary goals of the website are to increase revenue and introduce the business to the digital world. As CossiePlay is a family-run business, there is a lack of capital for expansion and/ or e-commerce. Therefore, a constant flow of orders is required to keep business running. Other goals of the website include targetting audience to attend the monthly party hosted by the company as an alternative source of revenue, and also this website serves as a foundation for posible e-commerce expansion in the future.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The Success Evaluation of the website can be calculated in two parts. The first being the increase in the actual number of orders and the second being the increase in number of Sign ups for the monthly party. The mere increase in number of emails received for enquiries since the website launched could also be taken into account, but it is more vulnerable to exploitation (by bots,spam,etc.).</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>1. As the business owners have requested, the website is targeted specifically toward young adults and high school kids, approximately between the ages of 16 - 30.
<br><br>
2. The website in intentionally designed to target the specified audience using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It uses a color palette that consists of Vibrant and Bright colors.</p></li>
<li><p>The style of design and bubble shaped images generally attract younger audience.</p></li>
<li><p>A bold and eye catching font is used for headings, as young people don't tend to stay on a webpage unless it catches their attention.</p></li>
<li><p>The content is formatted extensively. The important information is almost always placed first. The entire content is also there in a pleasing font, if the user prefers to stay and read.</p></li> 
</ul>
